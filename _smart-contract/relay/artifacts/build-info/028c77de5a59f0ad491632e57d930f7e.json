@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"errors\":{\"InvalidInitialization()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is already initialized.\"}],\"NotInitializing()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is not initializing.\"}]},\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"details\":{\"constantOptimizer\":true,\"cse\":true,\"deduplicate\":true,\"inliner\":true,\"jumpdestRemover\":true,\"orderLiterals\":true,\"peephole\":true,\"simpleCounterForLoopUncheckedIncrement\":true,\"yul\":true,\"yulDetails\":{\"optimizerSteps\":\"u:fDnTOcmuO\",\"stackAllocation\":true}},\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xdb4d24ee2c087c391d587cd17adfe5b3f9d93b3110b1388c2ab6c7c0ad1dcd05\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ab7b6d5b9e2b88176312967fe0f0e78f3d9a1422fa5e4b64e2440c35869b5d08\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXKYWWyzcLg1B2k7Sb1qkEXgLCYfXecR9wYW5obRzWP1Q\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[],"types":null}}},"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/ContextUpgradeable.sol":{"ContextUpgradeable":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"name":"InvalidInitialization","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"NotInitializing","type":"error"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint64","name":"version","type":"uint64"}],"name":"Initialized","type":"event"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.27+commit.40a35a09\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"InvalidInitialization\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"NotInitializing\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":false,\"internalType\":\"uint64\",\"name\":\"version\",\"type\":\"uint64\"}],\"name\":\"Initialized\",\"type\":\"event\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data.
